  "topic": "DBSCAN",
  "description": "DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together points that are closely packed together while marking points that lie alone in low-density regions as outliers. It is particularly effective in identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes and handling noise in data.",
  "common_types": [
    {
      "name": "Standard DBSCAN",
      "description": "The basic implementation of the DBSCAN algorithm, which uses two parameters: epsilon (the maximum distance between two samples for them to be considered in the same neighborhood) and minPoints (the minimum number of points required to form a dense region)."

    {
      "name": "OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify Clustering Structure)",
      "description": "An extension of DBSCAN that creates an ordering of points based on their density, allowing for the identification of clusters of varying densities and providing a more detailed representation of cluster structure."

    {
      "name": "HDBSCAN (Hierarchical DBSCAN)",
      "description": "An extension of DBSCAN that combines hierarchical clustering with density-based clustering, allowing for the discovery of clusters in varying densities and providing more flexibility in cluster analysis."

    {
      "name": "DBSCAN with Varying Density",
      "description": "An adaptation of the standard DBSCAN that allows for varying densities across clusters, using different parameters for different regions of the data space."
