      "name": "Standard K-means",

      "description": "A variant of k-means that uses actual data points (medoids) as cluster centers instead of means, making it more robust to noise and outliers."

      "description": "A soft clustering method where each data point can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership, rather than being assigned to a single cluster."
