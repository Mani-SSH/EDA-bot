    {
      "name": "Normal Distribution",
      "description": "Also known as Gaussian distribution, it is a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution where most of the data points cluster around the mean."
    },
    {
      "name": "Uniform Distribution",
      "description": "In a uniform distribution, all outcomes are equally likely. The probability is constant across the range of possible values."
    },
    {
      "name": "Skewed Distribution",
      "description": "A distribution that is not symmetrical. It can be left-skewed (negatively skewed) or right-skewed (positively skewed), depending on the direction of the tail."
    },
    {
      "name": "Bimodal Distribution",
      "description": "Characterized by having two distinct peaks. This occurs when the data contains two different modes."

      "description": "Displays the data distribution based on a five-number summary (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum), highlighting outliers."
